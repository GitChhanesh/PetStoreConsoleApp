## Folder Structure

- **`PetStoreConsoleApp`**
  - `Program.cs`: Main entry point for the console application.
  - `PetStoreService.cs`: Service class to interact with the PetStore API.
  - `Models`: Folder containing classes representing the data model (e.g., Pet, Category).
  - `Controllers`: Folder containing classes handling the application logic.
  - `Services`: Folder containing classes related to external services, like API interactions.
  - `Views`: Folder containing view classes.
  - `Tests`: Folder containing Xunit test cases.

### Class Descriptions

#### `Program.cs`

The `Program.cs` file serves as the main entry point for the console application. It likely contains the `Main` method, where the application execution begins.

#### `PetStoreService.cs`

`PetStoreService.cs` is a service class responsible for interacting with the PetStore API. It may contain methods to perform operations such as retrieving pets, adding new pets, and updating pet information.

#### `Models` Folder

The `Models` folder contains classes that represent the data model used in the application. This includes entities like `Pet` and `Category`, which are essential for organizing and managing data within the application.

#### `Controllers` Folder

The `Controllers` folder houses classes responsible for handling the application logic. These classes may orchestrate the flow of the program, coordinating interactions between the user interface, services, and data models.

#### `Services` Folder

In the `Services` folder, you can find classes that are related to external services, such as API interactions. `PetStoreService.cs` mentioned earlier might reside in this folder.

#### `Views` Folder

The `Views` folder contains classes that represent the views or user interfaces of the application. These classes may handle the presentation and user interaction aspects.

#### `Tests` Folder

The `Tests` folder holds Xunit test cases for the various components of the application. Writing tests is crucial for ensuring the reliability and correctness of the codebase.
